# numbot Library Improvement Plan

This document outlines specific improvements for the numbot library based on analysis of the current codebase. Each improvement is structured as a concrete, implementable task that can be completed by either humans or AI assistants.

## 1. Core Functionality Improvements

### 1.1 Enhanced Error Handling

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling to the `parseLines` and `parseLine` functions to deal with malformed input
- [ ] Implement validation for parser rule definitions to ensure they follow expected structure
- [ ] Create custom error classes (e.g., `ParserError`, `ValidationError`) for better error reporting
- [ ] Add debug mode that provides detailed information about parsing failures

### 1.2 Extensible Parser System

- [ ] Refactor the parser mechanism to allow for plugin-style rule extensions
- [ ] Create a builder pattern for parser rule creation (e.g., `new ParserRuleBuilder().addMatcher(...).addTransformer(...)`)
- [ ] Implement a rule registry system allowing users to register custom parsers
- [ ] Add composable parser components that can be mixed and matched

### 1.3 Input Preprocessing

- [ ] Add preprocessing hooks to normalize and sanitize input text before parsing
- [ ] Implement options for handling different line ending types
- [ ] Add support for ignoring comments or specific patterns in input
- [ ] Create utility functions for text normalization (case handling, whitespace, etc.)

## 2. Feature Additions

### 2.1 Improved DateTime Handling

- [ ] Add timezone support to date parsing and handling
- [ ] Implement relative date references (e.g., "next friday", "3 days ago")
- [ ] Create configurable date formatting options for output
- [ ] Support for ISO 8601 and additional date format standards

### 2.2 Enhanced Statistics and Analysis

- [ ] Add moving averages and trends to statistical analysis
- [ ] Implement forecasting capabilities based on historical data
- [ ] Create visualization helpers beyond the simple babar charts
- [ ] Add exporters for common formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- [ ] Support for statistical aggregations like median, mode, percentiles

### 2.3 Query System

- [ ] Build a query DSL for filtering and analyzing parsed data
- [ ] Implement a lightweight SQL-like query interface
- [ ] Create standard query templates for common operations
- [ ] Add result pagination and sorting capabilities

## 3. API and Interface Improvements

### 3.1 Stable and Documented API

- [ ] Define a stable v1.0 API with proper versioning
- [ ] Create comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all public methods
- [ ] Generate API documentation site with examples
- [ ] Add migration guide for users of pre-1.0 versions

### 3.2 Improved Configuration

- [ ] Implement a unified configuration system
- [ ] Support for loading configurations from files (JSON, YAML)
- [ ] Create sensible defaults with clear overrides
- [ ] Add runtime configuration updates

### 3.3 Type System

- [ ] Strengthen TypeScript definitions with more specific types
- [ ] Add generics to allow typed parser results
- [ ] Create utility types for common parser patterns
- [ ] Improve exported type definitions for better IDE support

## 4. Performance and Optimization

### 4.1 Parser Performance

- [ ] Profile and optimize the regex-based parser for large inputs
- [ ] Implement parser result caching
- [ ] Add stream-based parsing for very large files
- [ ] Optimize the matcher search algorithm

### 4.2 Memory Usage

- [ ] Implement lazy evaluation options for large datasets
- [ ] Add memory-efficient data structures for large result sets
- [ ] Create options for limiting memory usage during parsing

## 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

### 5.1 Test Coverage

- [ ] Increase test coverage to at least 90% of codebase
- [ ] Add property-based testing for parser robustness
- [ ] Implement integration tests with real-world examples
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks and regression tests

### 5.2 Code Quality

- [ ] Add ESLint configuration with strict rules
- [ ] Implement automated code formatting with Prettier
- [ ] Create pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- [ ] Add complexity metrics and enforce limits

## 6. Developer Experience

### 6.1 Examples and Documentation

- [ ] Create a comprehensive getting started guide
- [ ] Add examples for common use cases in README
- [ ] Develop a cookbook with advanced usage patterns
- [ ] Create interactive examples using documentation tools

### 6.2 Developer Tools

- [ ] Create a CLI tool for testing parsers
- [ ] Implement a debug visualization tool
- [ ] Add a REPL for interactive parser testing
- [ ] Create parser rule validation tools

## 7. Ecosystem Development

### 7.1 Integration with Other Tools

- [ ] Create adapters for common logging systems
- [ ] Implement browser compatibility layer
- [ ] Build React component for log visualization (expand on the examples/react directory)
- [ ] Create Node.js stream interfaces

### 7.2 Extensions and Plugins

- [ ] Design plugin architecture for custom extensions
- [ ] Create standard plugins for common formats (Apache logs, etc.)
- [ ] Implement serialization plugins for different output formats
- [ ] Build domain-specific language parsers for common use cases

## 8. Bug Fixes

### 8.1 Date Parsing Issues

- [ ] Fix the date parser for format "DD.MM." to correctly set the day value (currently when parsing "11.3. run 55min", it sets the day to 22nd instead of 11th)
- [ ] Ensure proper year handling when the year is not explicitly specified in date formats
- [ ] Fix handling of trailing periods in date formats (e.g., "11.3.")
- [ ] Add validation to ensure parsed dates are consistent with the input text

## Next Steps

The most immediate priorities should be:

1. Fixing critical date parsing bugs (8.1)
2. Stabilizing the API (3.1)
3. Enhancing error handling (1.1)
4. Improving documentation (6.1)
5. Increasing test coverage (5.1)

These improvements will provide the foundation for more advanced features while ensuring the library remains stable and usable.
